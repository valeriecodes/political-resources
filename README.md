Have something to add?

* The easiest way is to make a pull request, if you are able. The pages are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and if you've never made a pull request you can learn how from [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* If you'd rather not bother with a PR, open [an issue](https://github.com/valeriecodes/the-resistance/) or [email me](mailto:valerie.woolard@gmail.com).

Questions, comments? I'm [@valeriecodes](https://twitter.com/valeriecodes) on Twitter.
